## Passionate about OSS

Ryan Jeffery, an Australian, has created a web site which discusses Operational Support Systems called [Passionate About OSS](https://passionateaboutoss.com/)

He has been working on a simpler model to help explain OSS systems called the [OSS Sandpit](https://passionateaboutoss.com/building-a-personal-oss-sandpit/)

This model is much simpler and more realistic than the TAM, when trying to construct a system for the average network.
